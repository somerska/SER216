This school project is a java8 implementation of a classic game, Connect 4.  With that in mind, the course was focused on some key ideas, none of which are
good architecture or design.  With that in mind, this is not an indication of any production software that I'd write.  This repo exists to demonstrate that I have done some programming in Java.
